just a quick heads up:

frontend/ and server/ are a very janky implementation on **how** you could implement it, i just wrote it as a quick proof of concept
parser/ is a better look at how my code will actually look.

BELOW ASSUMES U ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THIS README, PLEASE OPEN THREE TERMINALS (ONE FOR EACH SETUP) AND MAKE SURE THE DIRECTORY IS SAME AS THIS README

you will need node & npm

// server setup
```
1: cd server

2: npm install

3: node index.js
```

// parser setup
```
1: cd parser

2: cat README.md (follow steps here)
```

// frontend setup
```
1: cd frontend

2: npm install

3: npm run dev
```

- then go to localhost:3000 and upload a .ts file (THERE IS NOTHING CHECKING ITS ACTUALLY A TS FILE)

all is working on my end as of 22nd aug
